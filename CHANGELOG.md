## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `apipi microvm shell` boots the same Firecracker guest as agent
  sessions and attaches a serial shell. It does not start the API.
  TAP, NAT, `ip_forward`, and jailer failures name the step and say
  when root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is missing.
- `apipi install` installs the pinned Pi CLI. `apipi check` verifies
  requirements without binding HTTP.
- Unset `DATABASE_URL` uses SQLite at `.apipi/apipi.db`. SQLite is
  enough for one process. Postgres when the store is shared.
  `apipi migrate` applies schema; `apipi serve` does not.

### Changed

- `output_text.delta` is live SSE only. It is not stored. Reconnect
  and export use `output_text.done` and items.
- File SQLite uses WAL. Production docs list when Postgres is
  required.
- Logs are JSON lines on stderr by default. `APIPI_LOG_FORMAT=text`
  is the laptop opt-in.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

First public release. Install from PyPI as `geki-apipi`. The import
package and CLI stay `apipi`.

### Added

- OpenAI Agents API compatible gateway (`apipi serve`) with Postgres as
  the source of truth.
- Pi harness over RPC. Run modes `none` (local/dev) and `microvm`
  (Firecracker). Production uses `microvm`.
- Agents, sessions, events, turns, items, artifacts, and export.
- Tenant-scoped auth via a callback. The gateway does not store keys.
- Optional S3-compatible artifact storage (`geki-apipi[s3]`).

### Changed

- Alembic history is a single baseline revision (`0001_initial`) that
  matches the current schema. Pre-0.1.0 databases have no upgrade path
  through the old revision chain. Recreate the database and run
  `apipi migrate`, or stamp `0001_initial` if the schema already
  matches.
