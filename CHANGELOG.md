# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `apipi install` asks Pi / MicroVM / both on a TTY. `--microvm`
  downloads pinned Firecracker 1.17.0 and builds guest images.
  Unset kernel and rootfs paths use those cache files when they
  exist. `apipi microvm shell` re-runs under sudo with `PATH` and
  `HOME` kept.
- `POST /v1/agents/sessions/{id}/events` accepts the OpenAI nested
  `events` envelope and the existing flat body.
- OpenAI compatibility page with comparison tables for routes, fields,
  lifecycle, and errors.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- `apipi microvm shell` boots the same Firecracker guest as agent
  sessions and attaches a serial shell. TAP, NAT, `ip_forward`, and
  jailer failures name the step and say when root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`
  is missing.
- `apipi install` installs the pinned Pi CLI. `apipi check` verifies
  requirements without binding HTTP.
- Unset `DATABASE_URL` uses SQLite at `.apipi/apipi.db`. SQLite is
  enough for one process. Postgres when the store is shared.
  `apipi migrate` applies schema before `apipi serve`.

### Changed

- `output_text.delta` is live SSE only. Reconnect and export use
  `output_text.done` and items.
- File SQLite uses WAL. Production docs list when Postgres is
  required.
- Logs are JSON lines on stderr by default. `APIPI_LOG_FORMAT=text`
  is the laptop opt-in.
- Product docs use complete sentences. README and Get started cover
  install from PyPI and from a git checkout.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

First public release. Install from PyPI as `geki-apipi`. The import
package and CLI stay `apipi`.

### Added

- OpenAI Agents API compatible gateway (`apipi serve`) with Postgres as
  the source of truth.
- Pi harness over RPC. Run modes `none` (local/dev) and `microvm`
  (Firecracker). Production uses `microvm`.
- Agents, sessions, events, turns, items, artifacts, and export.
- Tenant-scoped auth via a callback. The gateway maps the bearer to a
  tenant.
- Optional S3-compatible artifact storage (`geki-apipi[s3]`).

### Changed

- Alembic history is a single baseline revision (`0001_initial`) that
  matches the current schema. Pre-0.1.0 databases have no upgrade path
  through the old revision chain. Recreate the database and run
  `apipi migrate`, or stamp `0001_initial` if the schema already
  matches.
